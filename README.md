_______________
The proposed project titled under UCR is “2.1 MW Wind Power Project by SVPL”, which is wind power
project located in Kutch district in the state of Gujarat (India). The purpose of this plant installation and
power generation is for captive consumption. The project is an operational activity with continuous
reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of 1 Wind Turbine Generator (WTG). This project has been promoted by M/s Simpolo
Vitrified Pvt. Ltd.

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 4599 MWh of electricity per annum.
The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive consumption by the project
proponent (PP). Wheeling agreement is signed between Panschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited
(PGVCL) and PP. The project activity would be displacing equivalent quantum of grid electricity
resulting in emission reduction of 4139 tCO2 per annum. The project activity has been helping in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources (wind energy) for generating
power which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants, which is dominated by
fossil fuel based thermal powerplants.

The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is expected
to be 4139 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be
submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.

Since the project activity generates electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable energy source it
will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts
